This folder contains scripts for simulating the responses of hydraulic heads in confined aquifer to forcing functions such as 
pumping of wells and variations in the stage of adjacent rivers.

`PBC_riv_stage_solution.py` implements the solution of Pinder, Bredehoeft, Cooper for the response of heads in a semi-infinite, 
confined aquifer to river stage fluctuation using convolution. <br />

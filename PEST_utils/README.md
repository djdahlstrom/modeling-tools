__What are PEST, PEST++, and PEST_HP?__

PEST is an open-source software suite designed to automate the processes of calibration of computer models, evaluation of uncertainty in the predictions made using such models, and many other things.

Go to http://www.pesthomepage.org/ to get started using PEST. To learn about the theory encapsulated in PEST, buy the PEST book here: http://www.pesthomepage.org/PEST-The_Book.php

PEST++ is newer variant of PEST that was developed for large numbers of parameters and observations and includes selected global search methods. Got to http://www.inversemodeler.org/ to get PEST++.

PEST_HP is a commercial version of PEST that includes advanced parameter search algorithms and methods for non-linear model inversion. For more information see the sections regarding __PEST_HP__ and __PEST.cloud__ at http://www.pesthomepage.org/.
